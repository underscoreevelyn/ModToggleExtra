# EvelynModToggleExtra
Hey, you can use Everest to mod Everest! Cursed!  

This adds some extra options for the enable/disable mods menu to make it slightly less annoying to use, at least in my opinion. I wouldn't recommend using it, I'm sure there are bugs and time will only make things worse.

NOOOOO they patched hooking everest internals :(((((((((( i hate you forever
